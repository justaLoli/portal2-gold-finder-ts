# Typescript / npm / vite learning repo

this is a learning repo, where i translated my p2 gold finder (which was written in vanilla javascript using unpkg) into a typescript, npm project.

learnt a lot during this process. May make a note or memo in the future.

this project is built upon nekz's sdp.
